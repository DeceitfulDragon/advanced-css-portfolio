# Advanced CSS Portfolio Challenge for Module 02

## Goal: Design an employee's portfolio
This repository should show that I can properly create a web page using HTML & CSS to construct a portfolio for a potential employee. I did not want to do myself, so I made up someone called "Eric Drummer."

I've used semantic elements from module 1 to help create things like:
- Header, Navbar, Footer
- Sections, Articles

While using my knowledge of CSS to make:
- A grid display for portfolio projects
- A featured application that's bigger than the rest
- A contact form

The clickable images for Eric's projects just return back to this repository, as I don't have anything deployed for them to link to. They are just mock-ups.

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
