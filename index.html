        <!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
        <section id="about">
            <p>I’m Eric Drummer, a software engineer with a solid decade under my belt, crafting and leading the development of scalable web applications that cater to millions. Now 31, I’ve navigated the complex world of software development, steering projects from the ground up to their successful launch.</p>
        
            <p>My journey kicked off with a Computer Science degree from <strong>University of College</strong>, sparking my undying passion for coding and technology innovation. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege to contribute to both startups and tech giants, each time leaving my mark through software solutions that impact lives globally. As a full-stack developer, I'm well-versed in several programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Go, and possess an understanding of both client and server-side technologies.</p>
        
            <p>What I believe sets me apart is not just my technical prowess but also my commitment to collaboration, user-centric design, and perpetual learning. Beyond my work, I'm an avid supporter of open-source projects and enjoy mentoring upcoming talents in the tech sphere, sharing insights, and cultivating an ecosystem of innovation and shared growth.</p>
        
            <p>At this stage in my career, I'm on the lookout for opportunities that challenge me to push beyond the conventional, with a keen interest in the Unity Game Engine and it's implementation of C#.</p>
